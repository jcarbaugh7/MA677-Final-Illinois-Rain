# In All Likelihood Exercises and Illinois Rain Data

- The purpose of this assignment is to practice the self-learning practice, as well as learn more about empirical distributions, order statistics, likelihood, etc. The assignment is meant to be an introduction to continued statistical learning once outside of BU's MSSP program. 

- First task involved reading Chapter 4 of Pawitan's In All Likelihood, and then working on some exercises. The exercises allowed for practice of the text material, as well as to introduce the methods needed in the second task.

- Second task involved analyzing Illinois rainfall data from 1960-64. We wanted to find the distribution of the rainfall data, as well as the parameter estimates. Then, using this distribution, it is discussed how to discern wet years from dry years, and the generalizability of the overall results.
